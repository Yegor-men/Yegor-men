# What is this?
All projects listed here are (as of now at the very least) pretty much entirely self taught. I'd like to see how far this can be taken, how much can be learnt, recreated and (hopefully) invented/created without formal education.

# My projects

## Currently working on:
- [replAI](https://github.com/Yegor-men/replAI) - A frontend for chatting with AI, aimed to simulate natural text message conversations
- [Small LMs](https://github.com/Yegor-men/Small-LMs) - Small language models of various architectures but recreated with my own code from scratch

## On hold / soon to start:
- [Latent space reasoning LMs](https://github.com/Yegor-men/Latent-Space-LMs) - A series of language models which think in the latent space rather than the token space
- [SMRL](https://github.com/Yegor-men/Surprise-Minimization-RL) - The idea that RL models can be taught via surprise mimimization, lowering the difference between the expected and observed outcomes of actions in some environment

## Future projects:
- [RWKV investigation](https://github.com/Yegor-men/RWKV) - A saint made all that I desired, a sequential, linear time, linear space LM that matches transformers: https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM, I want to look into it
- [Sequential token by token text encoding](https://github.com/Yegor-men/Sequential-Text-Encoding-LMs) - A model that is to encode a text of arbitrary length into a fixed latent space via sequential token by token encoding
- [Sequential frame by frame video encoding](https://github.com/Yegor-men/sequential-video-encode) - A model that is to encode a video of arbitrary length into a fixed size latent space via sequential frame by frame encoding
- [Stable Diffusion recreation](https://github.com/Yegor-men/sd15) - A recreation of the Stable Diffusion 1.5 architecture/model
- [Diffusions](https://github.com/Yegor-men/Diffusions) - Various diffusion based models of various arhcitectures but recreated with my own code from scratch
- [Realtime screen analysis and response model](https://github.com/Yegor-men/Realtime-Screen-Analysis-and-Response-Model-RSARM-) - A model that continuously takes in screenshots, its own internal monologue and produces some cohesive output. Designed to be as a form of autonomous agent with free reign


## Completed (I will not be going back to this / very little updates)
- [06/04/2025] [GPT2 recreation](https://github.com/Yegor-men/gpt2) - A recreation of the GPT2 architecture, largely aiming to recreate the attention mechanism from scratch. Once I figured the transformer blocks were working I moved to [Small LMs](https://github.com/Yegor-men/Small-LMs) for cleaner and more refined implementations.
- [29/03/2025] [Semantic de-duplication](https://github.com/Yegor-men/Semantic-De-duplication) - Detecting and removing mass duplicates from databases
- [22/02/2023] [Transformer Stock Trader](https://github.com/Yegor-men/Transformer-Stock-Trader) - A transformer based model to try predict stock prices. Just a simple test for feasibility. A quick test reveals its not so simple.
- [11/02/2025] [Tic Tac Toe with reinfocement learning](https://github.com/Yegor-men/tic-tac-toe-rl) - A model that can play Tic Tac Toe learnt entirely through reinforcement learning
- [10/02/2025] [Variable autoencoder](https://github.com/Yegor-men/vae) - Various VAE architectures, largely aiming to recreate the Stable Diffusion VAEs but also wanting to create a 16x height/width reduction vae to be used on 2MP+ images with fast inference and accurate reconstruction. While I created AEs, I'm yet to create a VAE, I'll get back to this once trying to create diffusion models.
- [08/02/2025] [Iris classification](https://github.com/Yegor-men/iris-classification) - A model trained on the Iris classification dataset
- [08/02/2025] [MNIST](https://github.com/Yegor-men/mnist) - A series of models trained on the MNIST type datasets
- [07/02/2025] [Harmonic Loss paper](https://github.com/Yegor-men/harmonic-loss) - My implementation of the harmonic loss paper and other experiments based on using euclidean distance as probabilities.
- [20/01/2025] [Pytorch learning course made by Daniel Bourke](https://github.com/Yegor-men/learning-pytorch-from-daniel-bourke) - My repo for following along with Daniel Bourke's pytorch learning course.
- [19/02/2024] [Neural nets in raw python](https://github.com/Yegor-men/raw-python-neural-nets) - My earliest project where I made neural nets without libraries and with only numpy.
