# My projects

## Currently working on:
- [GPT2 recreation](https://github.com/Yegor-men/gpt2) - A recreation of the GPT2 architecture, largely aiming to recreate the attention mechanism from scratch.
- [RWKV investigation](https://github.com/Yegor-men/RWKV) - A saint made all that I desired, a sequential, linear time, linear space LM that matches transformers: https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM, I want to look into it

## Future projects:
- [Sequential token by token text encoding](https://github.com/Yegor-men/Sequential-Text-Encoding-LMs) - A model that is to encode a text of arbitrary length into a fixed latent space via sequential token by token encoding
- [Sequential frame by frame video encoding](https://github.com/Yegor-men/sequential-video-encode) - A model that is to encode a video of arbitrary length into a fixed size latent space via sequential frame by frame encoding
- [Stable Diffusion recreation](https://github.com/Yegor-men/sd15) - A recreation of the Stable Diffusion 1.5 architecture/model
- [Small LMs](https://github.com/Yegor-men/Small-LMs) - Small language models of various architectures but recreated with my own code from scratch
- [Diffusions](https://github.com/Yegor-men/Diffusions) - Various diffusion based models of various arhcitectures but recreated with my own code from scratch
- [Realtime screen analysis and response model](https://github.com/Yegor-men/Realtime-Screen-Analysis-and-Response-Model-RSARM-) - A model that continuously takes in screenshots, its own internal monologue and produces some cohesive output. Designed to be as a form of autonomous agent with free reign
- [Latent space reasoning LMs](https://github.com/Yegor-men/Latent-Space-LMs) - A series of language models which think in the latent space rather than the token space

## Completed (I will not be going back to this / very little updates)
- [11/02/2025] [Tic Tac Toe with reinfocement learning](https://github.com/Yegor-men/tic-tac-toe-rl) - A model that can play Tic Tac Toe learnt entirely through reinforcement learning
- [10/02/2025] [Variable autoencoder](https://github.com/Yegor-men/vae) - Various VAE architectures, largely aiming to recreate the Stable Diffusion VAEs but also wanting to create a 16x height/width reduction vae to be used on 2MP+ images with fast inference and accurate reconstruction
- [08/02/2025] [Iris classification](https://github.com/Yegor-men/iris-classification) - A model trained on the Iris classification dataset
- [08/02/2025] [MNIST](https://github.com/Yegor-men/mnist) - A series of models trained on the MNIST type datasets
- [07/02/2025] [Harmonic Loss paper](https://github.com/Yegor-men/harmonic-loss) - My implementation of the harmonic loss paper and other experiments based on using euclidean distance as probabilities
- [20/01/2025] [Pytorch learning course made by Daniel Bourke](https://github.com/Yegor-men/learning-pytorch-from-daniel-bourke) - My repo for following along with Daniel Bourke's pytorch learning course
- [19/02/2024] [Neural nets in raw python](https://github.com/Yegor-men/raw-python-neural-nets) - My earliest project where I made neural nets without libraries and with only numpy
